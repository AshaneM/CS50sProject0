        <h1>Why Coding?</h1>
        <p>I want to pursue programming as I find it highly interesting and unlike any other; I want to start and develop my skills early and that is why I started the course.</p>
        <img src="img/CODE.png" alt="code"; width=50%>
        <p id="rightAlign">Gaming also helped in convincing me to do coding; I started using commands in Minecraft and from there on out, I became engrossed in learning how to code.</p>
