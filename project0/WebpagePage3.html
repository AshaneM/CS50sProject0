        <h2>GAMING:</h2>
        <p>Gaming, especially with friends, is definetely one of my favourite hobbies; me and my friends mostly play Minecraft and we have a multiplayer server that we set up and play in.</p>

        <h2 id="rightHeadings">BINGE WATCHING:</h2>
        <p>I use cable to watch TV instead of NetFlix, and watching FRIENDS on TV has always been an entertaining activity for me- especially during quarantine.
        I also watch other shows like Brooklyn Nine-Nine and Big Bang Theory.</p>

        <h2>YouTube:</h2>
        <p>On YouTube, I watch a lot of gaming channels and a lot of content had been uploaded during the quarantine; therefore, there was always something new to watch every day.</p>

        <h2 id="rightHeadings">PROGRAMMING:</h2>
        <p>Obviously, coding is one of my biggest interests and it has always felt less like work and more fun doing programming.</p>
